          Is vapes safe?
Vaping is not completely risk-free, but it poses a small fraction of the risk of smoking cigarettes. The long-term risks of vaping are not yet clear. E-cigarettes do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, two of the most harmful elements in tobacco smoke.

          <h2>Advantage</h2>
          Vaping can help some people quit smoking. Vaping is usually cheaper than smoking. Vaping is not harmless, but it   is much less harmful than smoking. Vaping is less harmful to those around you than smoking, as there's no current evidence that second-hand vapour is dangerous to others.
